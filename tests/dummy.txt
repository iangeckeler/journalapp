Today was long and arduous but it was well spent. Most encouraging was meeting with Sean near the end of the day to talk about CoEfficient. I realized today that there really is no reason to fear things in advance other than fearing them in the moment. Other than that, all you have to do is keep on through this path. Remember that other people are such a great resource. Whether that's Chegg, Stack Overflow, or other. These are all possible ways to be learning from others' mistakes. All in all I felt encouraged that there is so much opportunity for me. Just remember to stay sharp and be using your pain to learn from it. Sean is such a great leader and role model. I'm so glad to have his example in my life. I think that you need to do something to stop your creative brain from going on and on. Except maybe you don't maybe it's useful. Either way you can definitely be coding more and more often.

Do not shrink from your task. Today's idea is that virute is the highest and only good it is worth attaining. Everything else is an external and your character and HOW you do something is most important. Are you good in that.

Today has been absolutely DOPE, I'M so stoked to continue working on this project and to see more real results from it. I already know that it's going to be absolutely sick for people to be able to read their journals. I am progressing at an insanely awesome pace and I'm just so glad to have found a project worth pushing through barriers for. You were so right to just push through the barriers because you come out the other side in an insane way. I'm just so glad to continue coding, I feel like pushing through this project was really important. I love how you have to constantly be learning. Just be vigilant about your health and your carpal tunnel to prevent road blocks.

Good morning day! Man am I ready to tackle you! I don't however like waking up early and will try my best to add that to the list of possibilities. However, I also just know that I'm off the walls happy right now because of Tina. Just remember however that you must live by example and that actually pleasures typically die out and trap you. Any need more than the little that satisfies nature will grow without bound. I can feel it now. I want to cuddle with her, to feel her next to me. It is an addiction. Make it a worthwhile one. Make your improvements upon yourself today and become someone worthy of the love that you desire. Most of your life will be spent working. Work towards something that will energize you and spur you forward.
Today I really pushed myself forward through the difficulties and am so glad that I did. I ultimately learned a lot and I'm really.proving fast. I think it was so hard to push through but knowing that it will make me a better developer and that practicing against what is hard also makes you into a better person. Seneca and a walk in the sun was also a major highlight for me. I really feel blessed.

00011.10
Today so many learnings. First of all I had a more rough morning with Tina because she didn't sleep and was stressed but honestly I admire how she was able to keep things together. I really had a negative reaction at first and it took me some time to just trust in her and be kind. It is definitely not my first reaction. So step one is to meditate more. Next however I had trouble working and I think that's because either I'm in work mode or I'm in play mode and I had trouble doing both, I think because maybe it is hard to focus when you just want to play. I really love spending time with my girlfriend and we have a lot of fun together but only when I feel I've earned the time. I think the biggest takeaway today is that all challenges are tests. And it's about the better person you come out the other side. Every decision provided the opportunity to be a quitter or someone who commits and plows through obstacles like they don't exist. I like plowing. Keep cultivating a character you admire and do not stop.

00011.9
Okay, wow long and productive day. I spent most of the day working through and going back to some coding fundamentals. I finally settled tinto he node fundamentals of servers. It's really useful to me I think to be able to understand the basis of what's going on under the hood in these frameworks. I'm loving the coding even though it can be difficult to push through. I come out the other side much stronger person. Remember, your first app will be your most difficult and after that it will get much, much easier. I have had some more doubts about whether it is a good idea to go to CoEfficient or not.
Another really great thing that happened today was meeting with Stephen. It was so good to be talking with him. I can't believe he got into YC, I hope that he is happy. He seems to really enjoy talking with me, I'm glad I asked him questions and it was so cool to see his project for real. It is going to really make big moves and I wish at some point I could become a part of it. I really do want to be a part of the tech world more. I think that as long as I stay hungry and continue to develop my network things will work out well. Just remember to work out some sort of arrangement for yourself so you aren't desperate. Keep working hard and grinding and networking. You should also apply.


00011.8
Yesterday it's okay man, you can't change it. Just be who you can today. Think about ways you can be better. How can we win. Remember your why. Why are you doing any of this? There are people out there who need your help. You need to do your part to assist them because any suffering you experience now is because people didn't work hard enough or smart enough to reduce your suffering. You consistently allowed yourself to fall into the crowd and Chase ordinary baubles. This is such a wasteful time. What do you want? What is your compelling future? Become your own hero. Do something that amazes you and try and become better. So that you just have yourself. What would your role models do? Do that. Until you are your own role model.
Meditation helps so much. Just learn from your mistakes and pay attention. Remember to just make time for that. 
You bounce back hard, and fast. Remember to stay hungry and keep after those things which are most important to you. Today I was a giver because I took care of my mental health and was able to be present and a positive force for my girlfriend. I spent my time learning skills. I learned today that I need to walk the fine line between gaining skills and knowledge on my own and bringing them to others. I also need to really do a better job of drawing the line between breaks and focus time. I really liked grinding things out with Tina and it put me in a much better mood. However, be smart and recognize exactly why it is people are all over you. Abide by nature's laws. Meditate and positive media. Seneca was such a good influence today. Will start it over again and stop and take notes and digest tomorrow.
I'm in bed and have been having an amazing time coding. I think that the sentences that have the best dialed down are just so cool. I am really loving this project and can't wait for the opportunity to be working in the future. Just so excited for this. Also realizing that I can live very simply. It does not really take much to delight me. Simple times out in nature with people I love. That's about it. I just want to say I have enough today. I feel like today I could die. And that is enough for me. Just dial down your pleasures and desires.

00011.7
Such a massive day. Really realizing that on the grand scheme of things, patience and consistent efforts stand out far more. You really got confused today and put so much pressure on yourself and you literally exploded. It was one of the worst days you have ever had. Mistakes were not trusting your gut and buckling down, not being your best self, not following your plan. Remember that your plan is how you succeed. You deviate, you die.
You and Tina deserve big goals. People want to feel like the most important person, people want YOU to have the answers, people are looking to YOU to guide them. To tell them what to do. They want to know you are in it for them. There's so much importance to those people who matter. Family first. Family is everything. Remember to stick together and family will always be family. They are the most important thing. You ARE your family.
000
11.6
Yesterday a big win was just getting the skills I needed and coding for two hours. I think it's so important tokeep knocking out these goals.
000

11.5
Today I was a giver because I spent a lot of my time and energy and effort into making myself a better person. You constantly have to keep yourself sharp in this department. 
Today I learned that actions really do compound over time and that you may be impatient, but that your impatience can allow you to pour massive amounts of energy and time into making something happen in the world. I learned that emotions come and go, and that being able to harness and control your emotions is one of your top skills. Remember to choose goals that complement one another and to focus on what you have for the week. 
Remember how much you are constantly dying and just how far you might be transported at any moment. Live with that knowledge in the back of your head. There's no time to waste, seize your dream. 
Today I could have meditated, put together a better meal plan in advance. Tomorrow I will invest by finishing my homeworks.
It's nice to not have to rush the journal entries. I am a huge fan of coding and being able to look back and reflect. I think I've learned a lot about the importance of fundamentals, staying focus, harnessing your natural energy by channeling it. I do want to make an impact though and want to be more. Going to bed earlier is nice.
000

11.4
Damn how quickly the days go by. Today I was a giver because I was present with my girlfriend and spent a lot of the day giving her moral support. This relationship really does give me so much joy and comfort to know that it is really important for me to keep investing in it and keep being the type of person she would want to date. Today I learned that there are simply so many ways to be happy. You can be happy in all sorts of ways but everything does boil down to luck. You choose what you would like but ultimately they do come down to just preferences. I spent most of the day with people who I really admire and that made me feel so loved and cared for. I really want to give back to them. Depression is something we need to fight. Today I invested in my future by spending a lot of time on my body, and on my skills.
000
11.1
Carpal tunnel coming back, God that is scaring me. Realizing just how important it is to be consistent. You can never been too safe with that. Today I was a giver because I helped Ashley with her work. I was also a giver by sending kind words to Tina and giving advice to Jack. Today I learned that consistency over time really is what creates the conditions for good or for bad. With that in mind, I really need to find a way to make my carpal tunnel manageable. I invested in my future today by actually following my schedule, by looking up coding related things, by getting back into time tracking. 
000
10.30
This morning I'm so grateful to be pursuing self-actualization in a world where the marketing is so important. For that reason, I just can't wait until I can start to spend more and more of my time on a project of my own design. These goals will pull me forward. Just do the best you can do. I am however in need of direct focus.
Just so glad today for sticking to my schedule. I recognize that if you plan ahead and create time in advance by working hard you can spend it wisely. But only if you protect it and see every moment as valuable. I think that measuring and tracking my time is totally useful. Today I was so glad to finish my work and meet with Tina. All in all a pretty crazy day. I was a giver today by smiling at all those around me and by being my best self. I am so excited to continue this process of hacking and doing something each day towards solidifying these goals.
000
10.29
Today I was a giver because I put my attention towards how I succeed, and my success is everyone's success. I also was smiling at everyone around me and provided a major spark of energy. Today I learned that I am highly distractible if I don't exercise and that it's like a daily requirement at the very minimum. I also experienced creeping issues again of my wrist which I need to stay ten steps ahead of.
I used today to invest in my future by going to class and getting the signalling that other people want. I also went to the networking event which was intimidating me and I think that was a really good idea. I'm super excited to continue on this journey of learning to code. 
I also can't stop thinking about how I'm made for conversation and keeping things interesting.
000
10.28
This morning I'm thinking about my career and how I can improve that. But ultimately please remember how everything you have you never even asked for. It's all about increasing "security". But all you really want is growth and the ability to build cool tools. Those are the important aspects and other than that there's no real need or importance. Just remember to clear your head and enjoy your day!
Feels great to have woken up early today!
Today I was a giver because I kept my emotions in check and supported Tina. I was a giver because I donated my time to hack and give ideas, and because I was able to bring a smile to many faces.
Today I learned that people skills and knowledge of psychology is so important. If you can do both people and programming you are a lock because most people can't do both. Today I invested in the future by going out of my comfort zone, exposing myself to more members of the community, and spending time with my girlfriend.
000
10.27
This morning I'm thinking about all of the things that I want today. I want to avoid pain and negative experiences of stress and starvation etc. To do that I need to act wiser and live in a way that will propel me to New heights. Remember that psychology is important. Doing things is largely not going to bring you happiness. The only real option is to do your best to avoid pain, think about how you can contribute to others and what you can do.
How are you going to reward yourself today for working? I see Andrew spending forever on his hair. You have to work hard to earn things. What are you going to give? Consulting possibly. 
This morning I tried spending more time thinking about other people and listening to 80,000 hours podcast and it really made me feel a lot more connected to other people.
Today I'm grateful for the opportunity to have worked hard towards something and continued to learn more and develop my ways of thinking about the world. I was a giver today because I got Tina a cake and did her a favor and was able to be there for her friend's party. I was also a giver because I spent the day working towards my career. This morning I found that particularly I have so many memories to be grateful for and I want to make that feeling of the heart and gratitude and letting it completely full me up become a major practice. I learned that happiness is really mental and that in fact, it's possible to do something really difficult as long as you have a reason.
000
10.26
Tonight I found it really really helpful to talk to Tina. We had an amazing time talking about the future, she helped listen to my ideas about psychology, and raised me to think about how I might pursue bigger and bigger opportunities for growth through role models. In all of these circumstances I don't want to be the guy who can't laugh. I'm not sure how exactly I'll bring the lightheartedness, but there is always time to rise above your situation and laugh.

10.25
Stop checking your email first thing in the morning and start learning how to code man. That way you can fix your dependency and start getting a job at a huge tech company and then transfer over. Both of these strategies sound good. Either get a job at a big tech company where you can get seen by showing what you build and crushing an interview, or try to be working at a venture startup immediately based on the few things you know. Either way I think that doing marketing for up and coming teams is a good idea, although remember it is very nice what you are going for. Also remember that there are a lot of things you want to be learning and doing. Remember, you need to create value to have value. People value money. You make money through ideas and through software. I think that the content people want to watch is mostly video and entertainment. How can you angle into the video side? This is a hard niche. Engineering or design.
Thinking that I need to really relax, because it will all play out and be okay in the end… You are just watching things pass through you. It’s not about you. It’s for everyone, it’s for all of us. Who are you going to be, what role are you going to play in this big drama? I think helping other people to avoid the mistakes that I made EARLY in life because that is how you form the world… Can you start speaking at high schools and getting the interested in technology, get them interested in being, doing more? That is the way to the future. I think in order to do that you’re going to have to inspire many others to follow technology and the possibilities it can bring.
000
10.24
Today I found myself really attached to my goals but also getting upset over there being a massive distinction between my goals that's why I need to develop a process and a plan and also the perspective and monitoring to not get too attached to those goals. 
I was also struck by just how good it can feel to have a community of people who care.
Thinking about how to be rational. To always make the rational and cool decision. In this case that would be to search for other opportunities and to express to Sean that you want time to become a better engineer. 
000
10.23
Today I really got into the math mindset. I think it's nice to be working on these things and to know I'm moving towards something but also it feels really not right. Deep down I feel limited. I think the reason is partly because I don't have autonomy, and also because I feel forced to do this and don't really see it panning out or creating the vision that I want for the word. In other words it feels a bit like an unnecessary sacrifice. I am grateful for the fact that I have been able to turn up my meditations. I am grateful for being able to do cognitive work and experience flow. I am grateful to be moving towards a vision I can be excited about. I really want more time to be learning from inspirational people and being a part of those circles and spending my energies trying to do good for others. 
000
10.22
Today I was so glad to talk to Sean and have a business meeting, to be reading more biographies of inspirational people, and also just thinking about filling my head with venture capital and startup world news. These are really the most interesting skills to me. Also, ease know that you are the only person who can go out of your way to learn advanced marketing techniques and fundamentals. Try to apply the universal skills from math of what are the universal programs you can use with people and consumers. 
000
10.21
This morning I'm thinking about how Andrew is Lazy and makes me lazy. I wish I could develop my own type of work method that allowed me more time and a better handle on my responsibilities. Remember though that you are unique it's all about doing the job that you were tasked with. If you can come in and provide consulting to one company, what would your area of expertise be in? Marketing and sales because without those you will literally lose business. The churn is what will kill the startup. Otherwise you are just set for life. 
There is a big difference between knowing and internalizing. I think that after many, many times these lessons will be well-learned. But until then you should consider yourself more and more precarious… skimming once does not mean you can rest easy. It is the application, not the awareness of ideas that will bring contentment and riches.
Tonight I'm thinking a lot about how time and attention (internal) resource management is seriously the number one skill for our modern day and age. There are so many things constantly pulling on us so the ability to sit down and really focus is going to be a major key. Today I felt really invigorated by having some amount of practical work to do. I've been really dejected having to sit and do equations which I see having no immediate practical application, although think about what people will say when you graduate. You can more easily portray that really crazy character. Just remember exactly what you are trying to accomplish. Break the system down from the inside. On a relationships standpoint, recognize that emotional regulation is absolutely Paramount. Finally, know that one of your big keys is yes, listening but also remember not to give in too much, maybe your key is to not be a great listener and always have ideas to bring to the table. Stick with your gut and what you know.

10.20
The job is to spend your life in pursuit of something greater for mankind. A kind of spiritual hope and gratitude that will fortify you against the worst. Gratitude cannot hurt so keep turning on the faucet. The goal should be to live well. Everything should be pointed towards the goal of living well... More and more figuring out your unique abilities and striving to live well. Everything is an escape from things that are negative and challenging. The man with a why can deal with almost any how. What's your why? 
So glad to have the friends you do. I recognized that in each moment you have an opportunity to bring the conversation a level deeper, to start asking people about the things that really concern them, to start empathizing. I want to become a more empathetic and caring person. Deep down I know that I have some empathetic aspects and that I can become a better individual. I also know that my key is through ideas and helping others. I want to be the type of person who is strong, resilient, funny, and wields their intelligence to help others grow and inspire them to learn more. I really do think I can do this. I also want to empower other people. In this universe, things may not be the greatest and there may be a lot of challenges, but it is ultimately how you decide to respond to those challenges that strengthen your resolve. You honestly have to much to be grateful for. Keep working hard, be thankful, and recognize that there’s always more to be done. 
Today I was unable to plan but I spent a lot of time trying to empathize with other people and that was really good for me. I find it difficult to always empathize. My body is wired to know that the bed is time for sleep. Really glad to be reading Senenca and excited to continue digesting and applying the works of a few masterful thinkers. Remember to be a philosopher king. To be ambitious and use your drives for the good of others but also to reign in your passions and desires.

Tonight I spent the whole night reflecting and it honestly could not have gone better. I have tightened up my personal philosophy a lot more and it has no grown to include and incorporate everything I know. However, these might not be the most important things. Remember that your whole purpose can probably be distilled down to as little as you need although the nuance will be lost. The purpose can be to yes put this entire philosophy into one place, but also to think about how we can be using  things to influence human behavior. Notice that the community raises people out above all things. And remember there are a lot of things that drive people to make the decision they do, but you should be thinking about psychology from a practical perspective. Specifically it can be analyzing and sorting through data from a variety of websites to match with psychological behavior. It will be possible to make predictions of when you are prone to depression or if genes code for your alcoholism. Three media I consumed as a kid literally shaped who I was, what I cared about. We are losing a lot of the diversity through the network effects. We are now not.profiting from risk.
Good to spend time reviewing your personal philosophy as well as those books which have made the largest impact on your life. 
000
10.20
Thinking about how seriously people take themselves it's honestly a little boring. That's the joke, you are a part of everything so get over it dude. I can't believe you keep ignoring everything! You are pretending you don't understand the laws of nature they are no use of you don't apply them. Also it doesn't really matter what you choose, just choose one and get really good at it so you can protect your time. Then you're done. What's something you would do on the weekends? I would read philosophy and create things and projects. I would actually be pretty down to code on the weekends especially if it's with other people. There is no doubt I could get good at software and making projects in my free time like scraping and making software for future technology. I would also be down to interview people.
000
10.19
Today I'm grateful for the fact that I have been meditating which has given me much better control over my mental states, the ability to think and learn from my situation. Finally I'm also so glad to see this band of guys who are great friends go onstage and play their message out into the world for this one shining time. It really is beautiful.
Things that went poorly was my shoulder began to bother me more and more and it is not the pain itself but the anticipation of more and more of these moments that bothers me. Unsure of what this will do to me. Missing one day of rehab and you feel it immediately.
000
10.18
Today I'm grateful for the fact that my boss reaches out to me and that there is always a lot to do. I am grateful to have a partner who cares for me. I also am glad to be relaxing and exploring all kinds of new music. I am glad to have my family who supports and loves me.
I'm thinking about how in the past I have not been very realistic about my responsibilities and it is a weakness of mine to sort of get attached to constant stimulation. In fact I should be used to things not going this way because it is really dangerous to not have anything to do. This way, I get too perfectionistic and really isolate myself, giving back to others an relinquishing the thing you think you need will allow balance to enter into your life. Remember a sharp focus on the present moment will open up the avenues and make you less concerned with the future.
000
10.17
Novelty is how you win, you love to experience everything and then to narrow it down to give it to others.
Today I ran away from my problems, I could have done my stuff immediately pressing in the morning but I have such a drive towards novelty and hedonism that I was unable to complete this mission today. I also like to tell myself a particular story about how things are. You can still hack your experience though to yield more and more pleasant experiences. Life is no purpose if you're not having fun. Games, learning, sex, humor, love. These are the purposes of life. 
Grateful for all of my things, for my ability to type with my fingers, for my newfound perspective.
000
10.16
Wow was so incredibly rocked by the experience with shrooms although I did remember that drugs expose you to incredible downside the rewards seem to be really worth the risk as long as you intelligent and conservative about your use. You come back and you have things you want to do but to lose all anchors and moorings from how you like things to go... These ups and downs are just a natural part of life. I will have to consider these opposing attitudes towards the middle path in life you read two books today which was a major win. At that pace you could literally read almost a thousand books a year. What a fun job that would be. But recognize there is no such thing as a free lunch. Keep it a hobby so you can continue to read and learn.
000
10.12
What a shitty day man. You had a great day except at the very end it was completely ruined by things with Tina. I think that your downside is extremely high when it comes to this relationship. Remember everything is uncertain. The only certainty is that things are uncertain. You need to continue to learn and grow and keep expending yourself to learn and grow. Don't fall out of routines and into something you're afraid of. Remember that so much of life is your own random adventure. These are all just rest stops. We are all the same person. Tina is you, she is going to think what she is going to think. She's also controlled by things and so are you, the lines are being given to you so recognize that this is a sort of weird fucked up show where you don't really have much control. We can still individually strive to be gods. That would be interesting right. But you really have to go for it you know.
000
10.11
This morning I’m thinking really hard about how it really is important if you care about achieving goals to surround yourself with positive and uplifting people… it is totally your connection to the world that you want to repair and maintain… if you want to help the world be a place where we can all love one another equally you have to put more attention into how to create that place for everyone around you… There is so much to be grateful for this morning… there is so much joy in your life… just remember that having that ability to interpret pain as something unnecessarily negative is a function of how much you’ve meditated and therefore also a function of the environment you are in… for this reason there is only so much you can do. Spend 100% of your time in the Bayesian pursuit of goals that will help to satisfy your natural inborn needs as a human being while also gaining the wisdom and ability to distance yourself from the negativity that surrounds that seeming randomness and unpredictability of life. It is not necessarily random, everything stems from prior causes but to us it seems entirely random because we are simply unable to predict the phase shifts. 
000
10.10
This morning I'm thinking about the fact that I have so much to be grateful for. I got up early and meditated and that really panned out super well. 
I'm not going to bed yet. Definitely feel like my last thing is to avoid all stories. In general I think I'm pretty much an asshole to a lot of my friends. Although on the surface I'm pretty approachable and nice. I think at all times I could really keep working. I think that everything we do we are assigned to and it is not our choice. We are simply windows into the experience of all that is. Realizing that so much of what I want is really just ego. Love and significance is what we are seeking. Remember to relax and spend time in the present. But also recognize that you are so lucky to have everything that you do. You have so much to be grateful for. In real life there are not always "bad"guys, there are just things that make you hate because there is no benefit. Everyone deserves a benefit and we are all playing games. Our whole culture is a series of games. We all play different roles depending on your biological luck and society. None of these things are real they are all the product of millions of people trying to shake the works to be how they want. This is the result.

Today I'm sluggish. I absolutely need to get up and keep working towards my loop goals. At the same time I need to be thinking about those things that I truly enjoy and doing those. I also really enjoy flow and need to keep working to propel myself in that direction. This semester's bet of keeping my head down in math is absolutely difficult. I hope it is changing my brain for the better and I wish I could have retained my brain cells from the marijuana phase. I don't feel great and that is why I need to do my best to create opportunities for my personality to shine through. I need creative outlets and I also need lots of people. I'm excited to keep improving my brain and my system of decision making.
Today was quite a long day. I fully exerted myself and was busy almost the entire day, but I really had such a long time working. And in the end I can say I actually really enjoyed the work. The math problems were really enjoyable as we were working through them. I can say the dip took about a year and a half. I wish people could work with me in my domain so they can fully understand my work and my intelligence. I think much of what I have to showcase is in problem solving and thinking through problems. I really love being a cracks or at these topics and maybe I can work my way up at some point. Either way I figured out that being busy the whole day was actually really fulfilling and enjoyable because the days go by so quickly. That being said, I really am looking forward to earning my spot so I can actually move up in the world. Software programming is replaceable but you have to be on the upper end of the totem pole designing new ways of doing things etc to not be replaced. Thus philosophy, math, and computer science can be the things I really dedicate myself to, the highest level topics. Then you can be exposed to many other industries. I really do like the idea of data science and data journalism applied to specific problems. Keep your head in these issues.

10.8
This morning I am feeling like my mind is all over the place again. I definitely need to learn to be able to just quiet it doen and also just immerse myself in tasks. The last thing, it’s not a competition but so many experiences are important because they are accompanied by a certain flavor. I really do miss my other friends and it has been a mistake to isokate myself. I need to be sure that my free time spent outside of work is either directly a project or building relationships with others this is the true key to success. Additionally, every human being needs some sort of recovery period. Remember it is all about how you think your body is doing. Make time to be doing things from a higher level and consuming new information and synthesizing it to achieve a better outcome. Realizing that it is really important for me to have personal relationships. I'm scared that after death there are so many possible things that could happen, it's not worth thinking about all that much because all of these people are Concious computers, it would be strange if they did not also pick up those biases.
Today I'm thinking about how I felt like there wasn't a lot I was able to learn today. I did enjoy spending time working on group homeworks and talking through things with other people. Although towards the end I really started burning out on the homeworks just because of how long and intensive they were my brain started to really dry. That being said, I think it's really good that I am still keeping up with my most important habits. I definitely feel much better and am a lot less prone to stress this way. Additionally, I think that in the mornings I really take my time to warm up. This is just how my brain works. Night workout felt absolutely amazing. I get so great to be out and running immediately after I got back I just felt so good to take everything in. I also had a good time talking with Tina. I'm thinking that in the future I really should surround myself with people as much as possible because that is my favorite condition to be in. What jobs require this sort of attitude? Remember, if you are busy, you aren't prioritizing. You need to find the highest leverage activities and lean into those more than anything else. Evaluate all others on a vicious time scale there is no time to lose. I really enjoyed working out. I really enjoyed reading Seneca. I really enjoyed group homework sessions. 
Missing the high level thinking but glad I identities this pattern. Dislike slogging through.

This morning I'm thinking about how I've been spending a lot of money and can't really afford to do any trips whatsoever. These are all things that I am not sure I can pay for. When I think that way I'm almost certain there is more work I can be doing to cover my ass. Each day you just sit and relax is a day you may lose things because remember early success sets you up for so much more of it later. It is much harder to succeed from a defecit. Momentum builds momentum so make sure you are getting out and doing the most important things early. Take gratitude for the things you have in your life right now. Perform a loving kindness. And keep learning and expressing yourself in a way that is beneficial to others. Also remember that time alone and time away form friends is not scary sad time. It's time you should be working to reflect and think upon your life. Remember it isn't all just about your actions and your life. It's about the global community. Don't fear monger but let's also think about what you could possibly spend your time building. What sort of communities would you like to build? I would like to build out the boardgame collective. 
Today I slow. I think there’s a lot to be doing with my day each day is an opportunity to move towards something. But remember you have to contribute in the way that you want to… this could be on the personal level… to keep your local community together. To do good locally whatever that means to you. To bring benefits. Use your signature strengths… what is the point of the wise people? To reveal to people how they might want to create better lives for themselves? I’m very sure that mediation and control over your mind is an extremely important aspect to this. I also believe that an understanding of the existential nature of life is quite important. Except that it is dangerous to assume that some things are bad… we should think exactly about how we can use our knowledge of things to bring about real life changes… This water stays in the goddamn cup… just because there’s no moral reason for the water to stay in the cup doesn’t mean the water won’t… The same is true for each of us… we must escape from this cycle through gratitude and loving kindness and meditation and also through striving. To recognize there are two sides to everything. Keep working hard. Keep employing very specific guidelines and feedback for success. Clear time pressure and allow things for people to be extremely focused. This is ultimately the point. 
Today was a really long day. Definitely a lot to think about. I think interpersonally Andrew was being a bit of a dick, or at least that's how I felt. He is stressed and then he externalizes that stress onto others which is really uncool. Although I feel bad for him because one he is suffering and two he does not choose this necessarily. I am rather confident that things stem from prior causes and you can even tell that for yourself that we are entirely hackable. If you think you are smart you will not use all the tricks you probably should to gain an edge. If you spend all of your time thinking about how things could go wrong that may also affect you negatively. Generally there are many reasons why someone would take a particular course of action over another. I am very sensitive to noise pollution. Think about how Kyra totally abandons her friends for the purposes of doing her own thing. That is seriously something that could send her flying off the rails. Wow it seriously is a really tough business to navigate more and more awkward relationships as people draw their experience from a wider net of negative experiences. There is little way to innoculate yourself against it. When your friendships go well your life goes well. These are things that people will not understand. Even if K have to drive Uber or flip burgers or something I am very glad I have been given the opportunity to understand the causes and effects of things. I am happy to work hard but I really need to think about my free time and how I can use it to better serve my long term purpose. 
Remember to look back this is a really valuable exercise. To see all the data brainstorm all the options, weigh out all the costs and benefits, design a plan, and then execute.
